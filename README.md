# PROG 1700 (Introduction to Programming) Project 1
## Insult Generator

This program will generate a set of insults based on the input that the user provides in the console. The nouns and adjectives that
the insult will contain is hard coded into the program therefore that data is not required to run the program. 

## How to use: 
1. When the program first starts up it will ask you how many insults you would like to generate. For this just input any positive number.
2. After the first step is satified the program will prompt you for the users name. For this you can enter in any string.
3. Once the second step is satified the program will prompt for how many adjectives to use in the insult. For this just input an int between 1 and 3.
4. Once the program is satisfied it will then print the insults into the console and restart.
